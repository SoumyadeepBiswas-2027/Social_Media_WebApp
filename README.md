# 🚀 Social Media WebApp (Under Development)

Welcome to **Social Media WebApp** — a personal project where I'm laying the groundwork for a full-fledged social networking platform using **React**, **Bootstrap**, and **React Icons**.

Right now, it's in the **very early stages** — just a barebones structure with a:

- 🧱 **Sidebar**
- 🎯 **Header**
- 📦 **Footer**

No responsiveness. No interactivity. No backend.  
Just clean, organized, component-based scaffolding to build on top of. 💡

## ⚙️ Built With (So Far)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ⚛️ React | UI Library for building components |
| 🅱️ Bootstrap 5 | Quick styling & layout (no custom CSS yet) |
| 🎨 React Icons | For consistent and scalable icons |
| ⚡ Vite | Fast build tool & dev server |

## 📸 Current State

> 🧪 **This is NOT a functional app yet.**  
> It’s a static UI scaffold meant for rapid expansion in upcoming versions.

**Included Components:**
- `Header.jsx` — simple top bar
- `Sidebar.jsx` — vertical nav layout
